# ESP32-based upgrade for old analog stereo amp

Specifically for a Kenwood KA-3020SE (~1994) but could be modified for similar era analog stereo amps.

* Adds BlueTooth streaming via one of amp's 6 RCA inputs.
* 'Standby' when no BT audio signal - ie turns of main amp.
* OTA wifi firmware updating.
